Remember you have spent 5 years building the fundamentals, and it's time to move forward instead of looking back at your past achievements.",

A wise man once said, better to be safe than sorry; you would not want to cry in regret when you get rejected because you performed poorly in the interview due to insufficient quality sleep!"

You can take the opportunity to step up as a leader if no one seems to be leading the group, or contribute meaningfully if your group members are all very active. Don't fight other candidates for the spot of the 'leader'. Scholarships value people who can be good team leaders AND team players."

I was of the opinion that we should increase the prices but as group leader, I had to take into account the opinions of my group mates. Particularly, one of my group mates was vocal about maintaining the prices, and I made it a point to understand his rationale. After discussion, we decided to increase prices to meet profit goals."

              "Ans: BNM is a financial institution that plays an important role in our country's development. It helps regulate policies and provides advisory on economic decisions for the government.",
              "3. What is the importance of international reserves?",
              "Ans: International reserves are assets our country holds that contain value, such as gold and foreign currency. These reserves function as a backup fund to sustain our economy during emergencies. International reserves are like a personal bank accountâ€”having more ensures financial stability and the ability to handle unforeseen circumstances.",
              "4. We have all experienced stress in life. When do you feel the most stressful moment in your life?",
              "Ans: Well, I won't say there is a single point that was the most stressful, but my entire life has been under a certain amount of pressure due to unforeseen circumstances.",
              "5. From yesterday's group activity, state 2 strengths and 2 weaknesses that you realized and how you are going to find a solution for them.",
              "Ans: One weakness I realized is that during the start of the group activity, no one took charge of the group, and we all executed our ideas individually. This highlighted the lack of leadership. I would try to be more involved and bring my team into discussions to lead them in the right direction. Another weakness was the lack of communication. Group members were doing their own tasks without coordination. To improve, I would encourage open communication to ensure everyone is on the same page.",
              "For strengths, one is that I managed to bring my group together after guidance from our mentors. I initiated a discussion to align our goals, assigned tasks, and ensured we could consult each other to overcome challenges efficiently. This led to better synchronization and a decent presentation. Another strength is that I consider my groupmates' ideas, break them down into pros and cons, and discuss them collectively to reach a conclusion. This ensures everyone's participation without being overly dominant."

Besides encouraging my team and establishing trust that we would meet the deadlines, I engaged in a comprehensive discussion with the management team about improvements we could implement. I delegated tasks to each individual according to their strengths and established a timeline for completion while keeping my teacher informed. In the end, the event went smoothly, the audience had fun, and we received great feedback from the principal. I learned how important open communication and adaptability are in a group project.",

              "2. Thoroughly research the companies where you will be interviewing, especially FGV, as they often ask numerous questions related to their organization.",

It can be monotonous to repeat the same answer for every question. You donâ€™t need to excel in every activity; what matters most is what you learned along the way and how you overcame obstacles during these experiences.",
              "2. Seek help from your seniors and parents (or others with more experience). Many seniors have already gone through this process and have valuable insights to share. Donâ€™t hesitate to approach them for guidance. (I reached out to three of my seniors for three different interviews, and I was accepted by all three!)",
              "3. When answering questions, structure your responses by addressing:",
              "- What I did (the activities I participated in)",
              "- What happened (the challenges I faced)",
              "- How I solved the problem",
